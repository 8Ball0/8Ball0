-  Hi, My name is Zayana and I am learning to become a software developer. What brought me to love programming was the creating process of writing code that has a function and getting to see it in real time. I also love debugging code even when it takes hours to fix small mistakes. It is like solving a puzzle. I have many interests but I love science and computers and I love listening to all generes of music. I’m currently learning the language JavaScript and I have taken some classes learning Python. I am excited to learn more about computer software and look forward to learning from others and collaborating on projects. My pronouns are She/Her. A fun fact about me is that I love to play the piano
